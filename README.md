Manual BGMI Table Updating (Basic Version)

Installation cmd - pip install beautifulsoup4
This is a Python script that creates a table for use with OBS. I created this project because BGMI does not offer an API to access in-game data during matches, and I started broadcasting a few games myself.
Feel free to use and host it in your own events! If you find this project helpful, giving it a star would truly make my day.
Thank you!
